Secure Password Utilities

A Python class for secure password management: generating strong passwords, hashing them with Argon2, and safely verifying them.

   Features
Secure Password Generation: Creates strong, random passwords using Python's secrets module, ensuring a mix of character types and avoiding simple repetitions.

Argon2 Hashing: Uses the recommended Argon2 algorithm via pyargon2 for robust password hashing. Configurable for time, memory, and parallelism to balance security and performance.

Timing Attack Protection: Employs constant-time comparison (secrets.compare_digest) during verification to prevent attackers from guessing passwords based on timing differences.

Memory Zeroing: Includes a secure_zero function to overwrite raw password data (bytearray) in memory immediately after use, reducing the risk of data leakage.

   Installation
Install pyargon2 via pip:

   Bash

pip install pyargon2
   Usage Example
	 
	Python

	import time
	from password_utils import PasswordUtils

	if __name__ == "__main__":
   	 print("--- Password Management Demo ---")

    # 1. Generate a secure password (as bytearray)
    raw_password = PasswordUtils.generate(length=16) 
    print(f"Generated password: {raw_password.decode('utf-8')}")

    # 2. Hash the password (returns hashed_password_bytes, salt_bytes)
    hashed_password, salt = PasswordUtils.hash_password(raw_password)
    print(f"Hashed password: {hashed_password}")
    print(f"Salt: {salt}")

    # 3. Verify the password
    is_verified = PasswordUtils.verify_hash(raw_password, salt, hashed_password)
    print(f"Password verified: {is_verified}")

    # 4. Securely wipe the raw password from memory
    PasswordUtils.secure_zero(raw_password)
    print(f"Password after zeroing: {raw_password}")

    print(f"Demo complete in {time.time() - start_time:.2f} seconds.")
		
ðŸ”’ Security Notes

Argon2 Parameters: Adjust time_cost, memory_cost, and parallelism for your specific needs; higher values mean more security but use more resources.

Zeroing Raw Passwords: Always use PasswordUtils.secure_zero() on bytearray objects containing raw passwords immediately after use.

Storing Hashes/Salts: Store hashed_password and salt securely in your database. They are bytes objects and cannot be explicitly zeroed from memory like bytearray.
